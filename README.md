Simple Software to help automate the process of online tasks relating to YouTube Live Events and Wordpress Web Page

So essentially I am working on creating a process of automation.  Here's the basic run down.  I open my wordpress page and create a new show which in turn creates a new page.  In there you have the ability to put in the title, description, add an image apply the date it goes live and so on.  There are many other things to add in.  After the show post has been made, I will create a YouTube Live Event, which I of course create a title, time, description, add in a tweet if needed, then select create live event.  It takes you to a new page to add an image (for thumbnail, and preshow graphic). Then I select to watch live, there I go to share the embed code.  I copy the embed code and open the post correlating to the show on the wordpress site and insert the embed code where there is a box for YouTube code.  Afterwards I select Update.  That is essentially it.  However I do this process for up to 20-30 shows a day.  

If I were to start from scratch I could take up to 2-3 Hours.  But I know a little about coding.  (I personally work with Maya and use MEL scripting mainly, and have worked with Unity as well, using C#)  That being said, I do believe I should be able to create a more specific software that can be more dedicated to what I need, with a nicer GUI, and less useless functions.  (What I mean by that is I have checked out Automate 10 and many other programs alike, and they can do what I want but no intuitively unfortunately)  What I wish to create it a GUI that holds in order,"Date,Time,Show Name, Season Number, Episode Number, Correlating Image for the show, and a cog on the side that will allow you to edit any other parameters necessary.

I have just created this Repository on GitHub, so in the future I will try to record the process I go through so it makes more sense to those that might be willing to help.  Fot the mean time I shall move on and continue my research.  

I am aiming to make this cross platform and stand alone (not sure what coding is necessary, maybe C#).  Everything saved within it's own directory.
